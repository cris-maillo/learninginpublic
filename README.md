# Learning In Public

**Public repository where I hope to upload my own research on a new, selected topic every week!**

It's my attempt at "working in public", and I'd like to encourage everyone to respond, question, reply, and ask. This will suck, at least for a while, and I will be wrong, so let me know why, be patient, and encourage me to continue learning and sharing. 

## Topics to come:

* Digital Gardens
* Blockchain
* Crypto
* Colour Theory
* Composition Theory + White Space
* ML/AI
* Neural Networks
* IoT
* Containerization
* Typeography
* UX Writing
* Quantum
* Cloud + Edge Computing



_If you never create anything, all you will ever be is a consumer._
