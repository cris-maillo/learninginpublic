# Learning In Public

Public repository where I hope to upload my own research on a new, selected topic every week!

It's my attempt at "working in public", and I'd like to encourage everyone to respond, question, reply, and ask. This will suck, at least for a while, and I will be wrong, so let me know why, be patient, and encourage me to continue learning and sharing. 

If you never create anything, all you will ever be is a consumer.
